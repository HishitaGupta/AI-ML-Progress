    "### Q1. Difference between independent and mutually exclusive events?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer (Say this):**\n",
    "“Independent events do not affect each other’s probability, while mutually exclusive events cannot occur together. For independent events, P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B). For mutually exclusive events, P(A ∩ B) = 0.”\n",
    "\n",
    "(Mutually Exclusive) \n",
    "Coin Toss:\n",
    "\n",
    "Event A = getting heads , Event B = getting tails.\n",
    "→ You can’t get both heads and tails in one toss, so they’re mutually exclusive.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. What is conditional probability? Give a real example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Testing:** Real-world mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. Why is normal distribution important in data science?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "“Due to the Central Limit Theorem, many real-world variables approximate a normal distribution, making it useful for modeling errors, noise, and confidence intervals.”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing:** Statistical intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. What is empirical probability?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "“The probability remains 0.5 because coin tosses are independent events. Previous outcomes do not affect future ones.”\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6. What is Bayes’ Theorem and where is it used?\n",

    "**Testing:** Business + ML link\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7. Explain false positives and false negatives using probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "“A false positive occurs when a model predicts an event that didn’t happen, while a false negative occurs when it misses an actual event. Their probabilities are critical in domains like healthcare and fraud detection.”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing:** Risk awareness\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8. Why is log loss preferred over accuracy?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "“Log loss penalizes confident wrong predictions heavily and evaluates probability quality, whereas accuracy ignores prediction confidence.”\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q11. What assumptions does Naive Bayes make?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "“It assumes features are conditionally independent given the class label. Despite being a strong assumption, it works well in practice.”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing:** Model realism\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q12. What is expectation in probability?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",

    "### Q16. If disease prevalence is 1% and test accuracy is 99%, is a positive result reliable?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
