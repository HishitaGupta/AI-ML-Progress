    "✅ **Perfect answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Correlation means two variables move together, but it does not mean that one causes the other. Causation means that a change in one variable directly results in a change in another. For example, ice cream sales and drowning cases are correlated due to hot weather but one does not cause the other.\n",
