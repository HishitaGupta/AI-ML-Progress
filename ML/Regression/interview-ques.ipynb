    "You can literally speak this in interviews:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Machine learning is the process of learning a function that maps input features to output targets using data. In regression problems, the model tries to minimize a loss function such as MSE by optimizing its parameters through gradient descent. However, if the model becomes too complex, it may overfit the data, which is controlled using regularization such as Ridge and Lasso. Ridge shrinks coefficients using L2 penalty while Lasso uses L1 penalty and can remove irrelevant features completely. This balance between model complexity and simplicity is captured in the Bias–Variance tradeoff.\n",
